# Nix configurations

This repo contains my nix-ified dev environment (through home-manager) and machine configurations.

Make sure nix > 2.4 installed, as it uses flakes.

Some commands (e.g. `home-switch`) rely on this repo being cloned to your home
directory.

Run `home-manager/install.sh` to quickly set up a home-manager environment.
